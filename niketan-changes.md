# Project Fixes and Updates (niketan-changes)

The following changes were made to the project repository to clean up structural issues, remove unneeded files, and align documentation with the actual code implementation.

## 1. Documentation Alignment
- **`Architecture.md`**: Updated the Agent Orchestration section to accurately reflect the 3-agent Sequential Pipeline used in the backend (`Semantic_Parsing_Agent`, `Dynamic_Verification_Agent`, `Policy_Routing_Agent`) instead of the non-existent 5-agent pipeline.
- **`Flow.md`**: Rewrote the entire data flow document to match the 3-agent orchestration step-by-step.
- **`implementation_plan.md`**: Updated absolute paths to use the correct username `skmaaz` instead of `Skmaa`.

## 2. Virtual Environment Best Practices
- **`README.md`**: Updated the "Quick Start" section to include standard Python `venv` creation and activation commands. This prevents polluting the system's global Python environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## 3. Git and Database Hygiene
- **SQLite DB Untracked (High Priority)**: Ran `git rm --cached` on `spin.db` and `backend/spin.db`. These were erroneously tracked by Git despite being listed in `.gitignore`. 
- **Deleted Duplicate DB**: Removed the unused duplicate `spin.db` from the repository root.

## 4. Folder Structure Cleanup
Removed several unused directories, tests, and redundant package configuration files:
- **`niketan/`**: Removed the empty, unused directory in the root.
- **`tests/` and `backend/tests/`**: Removed unused test directories.
- **`backend/test_api_endpoints.py`**: Removed the unused test launch file.
- **`pipeline/`**: Removed the unused pipeline duplicate directory in the root.
- **`deploy-apprunner.ps1`**: Removed the unused deployment launch script.
- **NPM Package Files**: Removed the `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `node_modules` present in the project root, as all frontend configurations already correctly reside in `frontend/dashboard/`.

## 5. Pulled Changes from spin-citizen-integration
- **Frontend Changes**: Checked out `frontend/dashboard/` from the branch `feat/spin-citizen-integration` to bring in all the UI and citizen components updates. Cleaned up deleted files correctly (e.g. `ApprovalPortal`, `MinistryLogin`, etc).
- **Backend Auth Changes**: Checked out `backend/spin_agents/auth.py` from `feat/spin-citizen-integration` to update the authentication endpoints and logic.
- **Rationale**: User requested to pull only frontend and auth-related code changes from the `spin-citizen-integration` branch without performing a complete merge, avoiding massive unrelated history conflicts, and strictly preserving the current backend logic of the `niketan` branch.

## 6. Backend Execution Fixes
- **Module Import Fix**: Added logic in `backend/spin_agents/__init__.py` to inject the project root to `sys.path`. This fixes the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'schemas'` that occurs when running `uvicorn` in the `backend` directory without correctly configured Python paths.
- **SQLAlchemy Async Fix**: Installed `greenlet` which is a required dependency for SQLAlchemy's asyncio support. 
- **Dependencies Cleanup**: Removed unused dependencies (`twilio`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `xlrd`) from `backend/requirements.txt` and explicitly updated `sqlalchemy` to `sqlalchemy[asyncio]` so `greenlet` gets correctly installed via pip next time.

## 7. Workflow Reports & Cleanup
- **Pipeline Cleanup**: Removed legacy test scripts (`backend/simulate_pipeline.py`, `backend/scripts/evaluate_adk_pipeline.py`) that are not part of the active 3-Agent pipeline workflow.
- **Launch Script**: Created `backend/start_server.bat` to automatically activate the virtual environment and boot up the FastAPI server via Uvicorn.
- **Reports Generated**: Analyzed the source code to document the backend's core execution flow and database schema into `backend_workflow_report.md` and `database_workflow_report.md` artifacts.
- **Dashboard API Auth Fix**: Restored the exact `require_staff` implementation (and `STAFF_ROLES` mapping) from the `main` branch into `backend/spin_agents/auth.py` so the `dashboard_router.py` can correctly restrict staff endpoints.

## 8. Frontend UX Refactoring
- **Paradigm Shift Copy Updates**: Refactored frontend UI copy across the dashboard to align with the new proactive "Public Demand & Community Needs" paradigm.
  - Replaced "Grievance" / "Complaint" / "Issue" with "Proposal" / "Community Demand" / "Improvement".
  - Replaced action phrases like "File a Complaint" and "Report an Issue" with "Voice a Need" and "Propose an Improvement".
  - Replaced "Ticket Status", "Resolution", "Escalate", and "Severity" with "Demand Status", "Adoption Stage", "Community Support", and "Priority".
  - Updated form labels and placeholders (e.g., "Describe your issue/incident" ➔ "What improvement does your community need?").
  - Executed these changes programmatically across all citizen and staff dashboard React components (`.tsx` files), preserving TypeScript interfaces and API payload keys (`grievance_id`, `specific_issue`) to ensure backend compatibility.
  - Re-wrote problem-centric sections on the landing page (`useLanguage.tsx`) into opportunity-centric wording (e.g., "The Problem" ➔ "The Opportunity", "Misaligned infrastructure investment" ➔ "Untapped community potential").
  - Executed a second pass across all components (`CitizenPortalHome.tsx`, `RaiseGrievanceForm.tsx`, `HeroSection.tsx`, etc.) to eliminate residual negative phrasing: updated "Existing Problem" to "Current Need", "Report a Problem" to "Propose an Improvement", "breakdown" to "service gap", and "repair" to "upgrade".
  - Implemented Google Places Autocomplete API in `RaiseGrievanceForm.tsx` using `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` and the `gmp-place-autocomplete` web component to allow native, rich address search for the location field in Step 2.
  - Added prominent "Go Back" buttons to the bottom of the manual intake in `RaiseGrievanceForm`, and at the bottom of the `TrackGrievances` and `GrievanceDetail` screens to improve navigation flow.

### Authentication Changes (Firebase Auth Integration)
- **Setup Firebase Project**: Created a new Firebase project (`spin-portal-hack-106`), generated Web App SDK configuration, and saved keys to `frontend/dashboard/.env`. Enabled Email/Password provider via `firebase.json` deployment.
- **Frontend Config**: Added `firebase` dependency and initialized the app in `frontend/dashboard/src/config/firebase.ts`.
- **Backend Setup**: Created `scripts/seed_staff_accounts.py` using `firebase-admin` to provision static staff email/password credentials and custom role/department claims.
- **Citizen Auth Refactoring**: Modified `frontend/dashboard/src/services/authService.ts` to replace custom REST calls with Firebase Auth (`createUserWithEmailAndPassword`, `signInWithEmailAndPassword`). Used a synthetic email wrapper (`<phone>@citizen.spin.local`) to cleanly support phone+password login flow using Firebase Email Auth.
- **Staff Auth Refactoring**: Updated `authService.ts` and `StaffLogin.tsx` to remove the mock authentication timer. Staff UI now authentically signs in using standard Email/Password to Firebase, retrieving robust Identity and JWT Custom Claims. Removed the ability to create staff accounts via the frontend interface.
- **Government Staff Accounts & SHARED_PASSWORD Alignment**: Updated `scripts/seed_staff_accounts.py`, `StaffLogin.tsx`, and `authService.ts` to implement the 12 government departments schema with `@government.gov.in` and `@nic.in` email structure, 4 role tiers (`admin`, `policymaker`, `department officer`, `staff`), and `SHARED_PASSWORD = "SecureSPIN2026!"`. Added preset one-click demo logins for official government roles and fallback verification for offline/demo operation.
- **Created `credentials.md`**: Generated a reference document detailing all 38 staff accounts across 12 departments along with shared default passwords and role assignments.
- **Updated Email Domain to `@gov.in`**: Changed all staff email formats across `backend/scripts/create_admin.py`, `scripts/seed_staff_accounts.py`, `StaffLogin.tsx`, `authService.ts`, and `credentials.md` from `@government.gov.in` to `@gov.in`. Re-ran seeding script to provision all `@gov.in` users in Firebase Auth.
- **Updated Shared Password to `securespin26`**: Updated `SHARED_PASSWORD` across `backend/scripts/create_admin.py`, `scripts/seed_staff_accounts.py`, `StaffLogin.tsx`, `authService.ts`, and `credentials.md` to `securespin26`. Re-executed seeding script to synchronize all 38 Firebase Auth staff user account passwords.

## 9. Environment & Virtual Environment Standardization
- **Removed Outdated `.env.example`**: Deleted `backend/.env.example` to remove duplicate and obsolete environment templates (e.g. legacy Twilio vars) that caused developer confusion.
- **Updated `frontend/dashboard/.env.example`**: Synchronized frontend `.env.example` with all actual variables consumed by Vite, including complete Firebase Web SDK credential placeholders (`VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, etc.) and Google Maps JS API key placeholders.
- **Automatic `.env` Resolution in Backend**: Updated `backend/spin_agents/config.py` to import `dotenv.load_dotenv` and automatically resolve `.env` files from `backend/.env` or the workspace root upon import.
- **Standardized Developer Quick Start Guide**: Updated `README.md` with explicit, reproducible steps for setting up the Python virtual environment (`venv`), installing dependencies, copying environment templates, environment location mapping table, and running dev servers across both backend and frontend.

## 10. UI Enhancements & Firebase Google Authentication
- **Fixed Floating Back Button**: Created `BackButton.tsx` component and integrated it into `App.tsx`. Implemented a `historyStack` navigation state in `App.tsx` so users have a persistent, glassmorphism `← Back` button on the top-left corner of every view (except the root landing page) allowing smooth sequential backward navigation.
- **Firebase Google Sign-In**: Exported `GoogleAuthProvider` from `src/config/firebase.ts` and created `citizenFirebaseGoogleLogin()` in `authService.ts`. Replaced the previous `window.google` script dependency with native Firebase popup auth. Added the Google Sign-In button to both `CitizenLogin.tsx` and `CitizenSignup.tsx`.
- **View Password Toggle**: Replaced the standard password `<input>` in `StaffLogin.tsx` with the reusable `PasswordField` component, standardizing the eye toggle (`👁️` / `🙈`) button across both Staff and Citizen authentication portals.



- **Added `firebase-database.md`**: Saved the Firebase implementation plan (shifting from grievance tracking to public demand measurement schema) to the workspace as requested by the user.

- **Added `staff-portal-change.md`**: Saved the Staff Portal overhaul implementation plan (RBAC, PWA, automation) to the workspace as requested by the user.

## 2026-09-28: Database Migration to Firestore and AI Integration for Demands
- **Description**: Replaced legacy SQLAlchemy/SQLite stack with Firebase Firestore, converting grievance models and logic to the new Demand concept. Also integrated Bhashini's 23 Scheduled Indian Languages dropdown and protected UI branding from translations.
- **Files Modified**:
  - ackend/spin_agents/models.py: Replaced SQLAlchemy models with Pydantic schemas (DemandSchema, DemandVoteSchema).
  - ackend/spin_agents/services/demand_service.py (New): Ported AI / Bhashini pipeline logic from old service to run with Firestore.
  - ackend/spin_agents/services/grievance_service.py (Deleted).
  - ackend/spin_agents/routers/demand_router.py (New): Created router for demand endpoints.
  - ackend/spin_agents/routers/grievance_router.py (Deleted).
  - ackend/spin_agents/api.py: Removed SQLAlchemy lifespan init, added demand_router.
  - ackend/spin_agents/auth.py: Rewrote get_current_user to use Firebase Admin SDK erify_id_token instead of SQLite lookup.
  - rontend/dashboard/src/services/demandService.ts (New): Created to fetch and vote on demands.
  - rontend/dashboard/src/services/grievanceService.ts (Deleted).
  - rontend/dashboard/src/components/citizen/*: Renamed Grievance files to Demand files (TrackDemands.tsx, CreateDemandForm.tsx, DemandDetail.tsx) and mass-replaced internal strings.
  - rontend/dashboard/src/components/citizen/CreateDemandForm.tsx: Added a dedicated select dropdown for Bhashini's 23 Indian Languages.
  - rontend/dashboard/src/components/navigation/Navbar.tsx: Added 
otranslate class to the SPIN branding logo to prevent AI translation distortion.
- **Rationale**: Migrates the core entity from 'grievances' to 'demands' using a NoSQL structure suitable for a public demand measurement platform, while maintaining accessibility and AI intelligence pipelines.

## 2026-09-28: Safe Firebase & GCP Credential Initialization in db.py
- **Description**: Added path checking for `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and fallback handling during Firebase Admin SDK initialization in `backend/spin_agents/db.py`.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/spin_agents/db.py`: Added `os.path.exists()` verification before attempting to load service account credentials, and added graceful fallback/error catching when credentials file is absent.
- **Rationale**: Prevents Uvicorn from crashing with `DefaultCredentialsError: File ./secrets/service-account.json was not found` when running in local development environments where the service account JSON file is missing.

## 2026-09-28: UI Component Import Fix
- **Description**: Fixed a broken import and rendering call in `frontend/dashboard/src/App.tsx` where `RaiseDemandForm` was mistakenly referenced instead of the correct `CreateDemandForm` filename.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/dashboard/src/App.tsx`: Updated `RaiseDemandForm` to `CreateDemandForm`.
- **Rationale**: Fixes Vite compilation error caused during the Grievance to Demand UI migration.

## 2026-09-28: Staff Dashboard Component Rename Fix
- **Description**: Renamed legacy `GrievanceKPIBar` files to `DemandKPIBar` to resolve a Vite compilation error where `StaffDashboard.tsx` was looking for the renamed file that hadn't been updated on disk yet. Also updated the internal component texts from "Grievances" to "Demands".
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/dashboard/src/components/staff/DemandKPIBar.tsx`: Renamed from GrievanceKPIBar.tsx, updated UI strings and component name to `DemandKPIBar`.
  - `frontend/dashboard/src/components/staff/DemandKPIBar.css`: Renamed from GrievanceKPIBar.css.
- **Rationale**: Completes the migration from Grievance to Demand terminology across the Staff Portal UI, fixing Vite module resolution errors.

## 2026-09-28: React Runtime Crash Fix (Missing Exports)
- **Description**: Added necessary function stubs (`getStoredDemands`, `getStaffDemands`, etc.) to `frontend/dashboard/src/services/demandService.ts`. 
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/dashboard/src/services/demandService.ts`: Appended missing mock functions and TypeScript payload interfaces.
- **Rationale**: During the legacy UI migration, `grievanceService.ts` was deleted and replaced by a thinner `demandService.ts` intended for live API use. However, multiple UI components (`StaffDashboard`, `CitizenPortalHome`, `usePolicyData`) still relied on synchronous local storage methods. Injecting these stubs resolves the `Uncaught SyntaxError: does not provide an export named` crash and allows the React app to render again without rewriting all legacy UI logic immediately.

## 2026-09-28: UI Component Export Rename Fix
- **Description**: Fixed the internal component export name inside `CreateDemandForm.tsx` from `RaiseDemandForm` to `CreateDemandForm`.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/dashboard/src/components/citizen/CreateDemandForm.tsx`: Renamed `RaiseDemandFormProps` and `export const RaiseDemandForm` to `CreateDemandForm`.
- **Rationale**: Solves the Vite `Uncaught SyntaxError: does not provide an export named 'CreateDemandForm'` error that caused a blank screen after we updated `App.tsx` to import the correct file name.


- **Updated `.agents/GEMINI.md`**: Appended the SLASH COMMAND SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS to strictly enforce predefined command behaviors (`/ask`, `/plan`, `/schema`, `/api`, `/spec`, `/review`) for tailored formatting and automated structurings without fluff.
