# Project Fixes and Updates (niketan-changes)

The following changes were made to the project repository to clean up structural issues, remove unneeded files, and align documentation with the actual code implementation.

## 1. Documentation Alignment
- **`Architecture.md`**: Updated the Agent Orchestration section to accurately reflect the 3-agent Sequential Pipeline used in the backend (`Semantic_Parsing_Agent`, `Dynamic_Verification_Agent`, `Policy_Routing_Agent`) instead of the non-existent 5-agent pipeline.
- **`Flow.md`**: Rewrote the entire data flow document to match the 3-agent orchestration step-by-step.
- **`implementation_plan.md`**: Updated absolute paths to use the correct username `skmaaz` instead of `Skmaa`.

## 2. Virtual Environment Best Practices
- **`README.md`**: Updated the "Quick Start" section to include standard Python `venv` creation and activation commands. This prevents polluting the system's global Python environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## 3. Git and Database Hygiene
- **SQLite DB Untracked (High Priority)**: Ran `git rm --cached` on `spin.db` and `backend/spin.db`. These were erroneously tracked by Git despite being listed in `.gitignore`. 
- **Deleted Duplicate DB**: Removed the unused duplicate `spin.db` from the repository root.

## 4. Folder Structure Cleanup
Removed several unused directories, tests, and redundant package configuration files:
- **`niketan/`**: Removed the empty, unused directory in the root.
- **`tests/` and `backend/tests/`**: Removed unused test directories.
- **`backend/test_api_endpoints.py`**: Removed the unused test launch file.
- **`pipeline/`**: Removed the unused pipeline duplicate directory in the root.
- **`deploy-apprunner.ps1`**: Removed the unused deployment launch script.
- **NPM Package Files**: Removed the `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `node_modules` present in the project root, as all frontend configurations already correctly reside in `frontend/dashboard/`.

## 5. Pulled Changes from spin-citizen-integration
- **Frontend Changes**: Checked out `frontend/dashboard/` from the branch `feat/spin-citizen-integration` to bring in all the UI and citizen components updates. Cleaned up deleted files correctly (e.g. `ApprovalPortal`, `MinistryLogin`, etc).
- **Backend Auth Changes**: Checked out `backend/spin_agents/auth.py` from `feat/spin-citizen-integration` to update the authentication endpoints and logic.
- **Rationale**: User requested to pull only frontend and auth-related code changes from the `spin-citizen-integration` branch without performing a complete merge, avoiding massive unrelated history conflicts, and strictly preserving the current backend logic of the `niketan` branch.

## 6. Backend Execution Fixes
- **Module Import Fix**: Added logic in `backend/spin_agents/__init__.py` to inject the project root to `sys.path`. This fixes the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'schemas'` that occurs when running `uvicorn` in the `backend` directory without correctly configured Python paths.
- **SQLAlchemy Async Fix**: Installed `greenlet` which is a required dependency for SQLAlchemy's asyncio support. 
- **Dependencies Cleanup**: Removed unused dependencies (`twilio`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `xlrd`) from `backend/requirements.txt` and explicitly updated `sqlalchemy` to `sqlalchemy[asyncio]` so `greenlet` gets correctly installed via pip next time.

## 7. Workflow Reports & Cleanup
- **Pipeline Cleanup**: Removed legacy test scripts (`backend/simulate_pipeline.py`, `backend/scripts/evaluate_adk_pipeline.py`) that are not part of the active 3-Agent pipeline workflow.
- **Launch Script**: Created `backend/start_server.bat` to automatically activate the virtual environment and boot up the FastAPI server via Uvicorn.
- **Reports Generated**: Analyzed the source code to document the backend's core execution flow and database schema into `backend_workflow_report.md` and `database_workflow_report.md` artifacts.
- **Dashboard API Auth Fix**: Restored the exact `require_staff` implementation (and `STAFF_ROLES` mapping) from the `main` branch into `backend/spin_agents/auth.py` so the `dashboard_router.py` can correctly restrict staff endpoints.

## 8. Frontend UX Refactoring
- **Paradigm Shift Copy Updates**: Refactored frontend UI copy across the dashboard to align with the new proactive "Public Demand & Community Needs" paradigm.
  - Replaced "Grievance" / "Complaint" / "Issue" with "Proposal" / "Community Demand" / "Improvement".
  - Replaced action phrases like "File a Complaint" and "Report an Issue" with "Voice a Need" and "Propose an Improvement".
  - Replaced "Ticket Status", "Resolution", "Escalate", and "Severity" with "Demand Status", "Adoption Stage", "Community Support", and "Priority".
  - Updated form labels and placeholders (e.g., "Describe your issue/incident" ➔ "What improvement does your community need?").
  - Executed these changes programmatically across all citizen and staff dashboard React components (`.tsx` files), preserving TypeScript interfaces and API payload keys (`grievance_id`, `specific_issue`) to ensure backend compatibility.
  - Re-wrote problem-centric sections on the landing page (`useLanguage.tsx`) into opportunity-centric wording (e.g., "The Problem" ➔ "The Opportunity", "Misaligned infrastructure investment" ➔ "Untapped community potential").
  - Executed a second pass across all components (`CitizenPortalHome.tsx`, `RaiseGrievanceForm.tsx`, `HeroSection.tsx`, etc.) to eliminate residual negative phrasing: updated "Existing Problem" to "Current Need", "Report a Problem" to "Propose an Improvement", "breakdown" to "service gap", and "repair" to "upgrade".
  - Implemented Google Places Autocomplete API in `RaiseGrievanceForm.tsx` using `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` and the `gmp-place-autocomplete` web component to allow native, rich address search for the location field in Step 2.
  - Added prominent "Go Back" buttons to the bottom of the manual intake in `RaiseGrievanceForm`, and at the bottom of the `TrackGrievances` and `GrievanceDetail` screens to improve navigation flow.

### Authentication Changes (Firebase Auth Integration)
- **Setup Firebase Project**: Created a new Firebase project (`spin-portal-hack-106`), generated Web App SDK configuration, and saved keys to `frontend/dashboard/.env`. Enabled Email/Password provider via `firebase.json` deployment.
- **Frontend Config**: Added `firebase` dependency and initialized the app in `frontend/dashboard/src/config/firebase.ts`.
- **Backend Setup**: Created `scripts/seed_staff_accounts.py` using `firebase-admin` to provision static staff email/password credentials and custom role/department claims.
- **Citizen Auth Refactoring**: Modified `frontend/dashboard/src/services/authService.ts` to replace custom REST calls with Firebase Auth (`createUserWithEmailAndPassword`, `signInWithEmailAndPassword`). Used a synthetic email wrapper (`<phone>@citizen.spin.local`) to cleanly support phone+password login flow using Firebase Email Auth.
- **Staff Auth Refactoring**: Updated `authService.ts` and `StaffLogin.tsx` to remove the mock authentication timer. Staff UI now authentically signs in using standard Email/Password to Firebase, retrieving robust Identity and JWT Custom Claims. Removed the ability to create staff accounts via the frontend interface.
- **Government Staff Accounts & SHARED_PASSWORD Alignment**: Updated `scripts/seed_staff_accounts.py`, `StaffLogin.tsx`, and `authService.ts` to implement the 12 government departments schema with `@government.gov.in` and `@nic.in` email structure, 4 role tiers (`admin`, `policymaker`, `department officer`, `staff`), and `SHARED_PASSWORD = "SecureSPIN2026!"`. Added preset one-click demo logins for official government roles and fallback verification for offline/demo operation.
- **Created `credentials.md`**: Generated a reference document detailing all 38 staff accounts across 12 departments along with shared default passwords and role assignments.
- **Updated Email Domain to `@gov.in`**: Changed all staff email formats across `backend/scripts/create_admin.py`, `scripts/seed_staff_accounts.py`, `StaffLogin.tsx`, `authService.ts`, and `credentials.md` from `@government.gov.in` to `@gov.in`. Re-ran seeding script to provision all `@gov.in` users in Firebase Auth.
- **Updated Shared Password to `securespin26`**: Updated `SHARED_PASSWORD` across `backend/scripts/create_admin.py`, `scripts/seed_staff_accounts.py`, `StaffLogin.tsx`, `authService.ts`, and `credentials.md` to `securespin26`. Re-executed seeding script to synchronize all 38 Firebase Auth staff user account passwords.
